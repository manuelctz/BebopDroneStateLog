# BebopDroneStateLog

This project controls a parrot bebop 2.0 drone using the pyparrot python interface for pyparrot drones (https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot). This project aslo uses ROS to obtain the current pose of the drone using different ROS libraries. The python script StateLogger also writes the current pose of the drone into a csv file for data aquisition and to later plot the drone flight.
